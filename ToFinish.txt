Bugs:

Fingering:	Correct vertical cost for thumb passing:
				add distance costs between thumb and all subpassing fingers, plus, one next finger.

MainModule:	Ticking track "Piano RH": fingering for 1st chord shows just thumb
				(or pinky for left hand) for the lowest of 4 notes.
=========================================================================================================
Improvements:

Fingering:	1. Dire Straits, Money for Nothing, right hand -> track 7 "Vocals 2"
					NodesLinker::LinkNewNodes() is taking too much memory.
				Midnight Oil, Beds are Burning, right hand - the same.
			2. Return just vector<string> without duplicating int16_t notes.

Keyboard:	Move to a separate static lib.

MidiParser:	1. Midi format 2 ==> each track has its own tempo map.
			2. Lots of additional checks (especially for Meta Events):
				http://www.somascape.org/midi/tech/mfile.html
			3. Unit tests for those additional checks.

MainModule:	1. Store all calculated fingers (vector<string>) in vector of fingerTracks.
				If (!fingerTracks.at(trackNo).empty()) do not calculate again, just SetScrollBarPos(100);
			2. Add possibility to stop fingering calculation if taking too much time
				e.g. with "X" button to the right of the corresponding progress bar:
					1) Move calculation to a separate thread.
					2) "X" button is normally disabled.
						Probably, should disable "Play" button during calculation too.
					3) Change question message to info with just OK button.
