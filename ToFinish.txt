Bugs:

Fingering:	Correct vertical cost for thumb passing:
				add distance costs between thumb and all subpassing fingers, plus, one next finger.

Keyboard:	Draw black keys after white
				(temporarily store data with pressed indexes, then refresh all black keys before BitBlt).

MainModule:	1. Correct aspect ratio more precisely.
			2. Money for Nothing, right hand, Vocals 2 - exits with error, so debug it.
=========================================================================================================
Improvements:

Fingering:	Return just vector<string> without duplicating int16_t notes.

Keyboard:	Move to a separate static lib.

MidiParser:	1. Midi format 2 ==> each track has its own tempo map.
			2. Lots of additional checks (especially for Meta Events):
				http://www.somascape.org/midi/tech/mfile.html
			3. Unit tests for those additional checks.

MainModule:	1. Store all calculated fingers (vector<string>) in vector of fingerTracks.
				If (!fingerTracks.at(trackNo).empty()) do not calculate again, just SetScrollBarPos(100);
			2. Add possibility to stop fingering calculation somehow
				(either MessageBox() or separate thread) if taking too much time.
