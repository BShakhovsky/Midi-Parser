Bugs:

Fingering:	Correct vertical cost for thumb passing:
				add distance costs between thumb and all subpassing fingers, plus, one next finger.

Keyboard:	Draw black keys after white
				(temporarily store data with pressed indexes, then refresh all black keys before BitBlt).

MainModule:	1. Correct aspect ratio more precisely.
			2. Dire Straits, Money for Nothing, when left or right track was chosen,
					couple of times it resulted in constant mistakes during playing
					(some bulshit was being played with SoundError, and nothing helped to stop it).
				However, cannot represent this error anymore, and do not know what was the reason.
=========================================================================================================
Improvements:

Fingering:	1. Dire Straits, Money for Nothing, right hand -> track 7 "Vocals 2"
				NodesLinker::LinkNewNodes() is taking too much memory
			2. Return just vector<string> without duplicating int16_t notes.

Keyboard:	Move to a separate static lib.

MidiParser:	1. Midi format 2 ==> each track has its own tempo map.
			2. Lots of additional checks (especially for Meta Events):
				http://www.somascape.org/midi/tech/mfile.html
			3. Unit tests for those additional checks.

MainModule:	1. Store all calculated fingers (vector<string>) in vector of fingerTracks.
				If (!fingerTracks.at(trackNo).empty()) do not calculate again, just SetScrollBarPos(100);
			2. Add possibility to stop fingering calculation if taking too much time
				e.g. with "X" button to the right of the corresponding progress bar
				(move calculation to a separate thread).
