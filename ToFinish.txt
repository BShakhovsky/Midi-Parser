Add possibility to stop fingering calculation if taking too much time
e.g. with "X" button to the right of the corresponding progress bar:
	1) Move calculation to a separate thread.
	2) "X" button is normally disabled.
		Probably, should disable "Play" button during calculation too.
	3) Change question message to info with just OK button.

MidiParser:	1. Midi format 2 ==> each track has its own tempo map.
			2. Lots of additional checks (especially for Meta Events):

			3. Unit tests for those additional checks.
