DESCRIPTION:
	Ordinary virtual 3D-piano, with an EXPERIMENTAL option of advising on which fingers to use to press each piano key.
	(!) Finger numbers are not correct in 25% of cases!  Keep this in mind and do not blindly beleive them.

	It is not possible to play on this piano using mouse nor keyboard.  It only plays *.mid (MIDI) or *.kar (Karaoke) files (you can find plenty of them over the internet).
	MIDI-files usually consist of several tracks, including percussion.  You probably would not want to play percussion-tracks on piano, because their "MIDI-notes" do not overload correctly on piano-notes.  So, in the most cases, you may choose any kind of tracks, but do not choose "Drums", "Rythms", "Hit", "Blow", "Strike", "Clash", etc.
	
ADDITIONAL FILES:
	There are several example MIDI-files provided with this package in the "MIDI" folder.  It is written in their file-name, which tracks are percussion.  Do not play those tracks if you want a clearer sound.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:
	Windows 7 or later.

HOW TO INSTALL:
	No installation is required, just open file "Piano Fingers 3D.exe".

	If you encounter errors about missing DLL's, try to install the following Windows Updates:
	The latest possible DirectX:
	https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35
	If some DLL is still missing, then try to install "Visual C++ Redistributable":

	If there is still some error, then sorry, you are screwed :(

HOW TO USE:

1. It is not possible to play on this piano using mouse nor keyboard.  It only plays *.mid (MIDI) or *.kar (Karaoke) files (you can find plenty of them over the internet). Drag-and-drop any MIDI- or Karaoke-file onto the applcation.

2. Select appropriate track for left hand, and another track for right hand.  Finger numbers for left hand will be drawn with blue color, for right hand - with red.  If you are not interested in finger numbers, you can skip this step.
   (!) This option is EXPERIMENTAL, and finger numbers are not correct in 25% of cases!  Keep this in mind and do not blindly beleive them.

3. Select any additional tracks in "Remaining Tracks" list, if you want.  Finger numbers for those additional tracks will not be calculated or drawn.
   Do not choose percussion-tracks (like "Drums", "Rythms", "Hit", "Blow", "Strike", "Clash", etc.) if you want a clearer sound.

4. If you want to go forward or backwards chord-by-chord, you can use scroll-bar left or right button.

5. Or if you want just to play the song in real time, press "Play" button.

6. By default each note is being played with different volume (note-volumes are also imported from MIDI-file).  If you want all notes to be played with the same maximal loudness, check "Normalize volume" box.

7. Enjoy :)
