__*(!) Finger numbers are not correct in 25% of cases!*__  Keep this in mind and do not blindly believe them.

It is not possible to play on this piano using mouse nor keyboard.  It only plays *.mid (MIDI) or *.kar (Karaoke) files (you can find plenty of them over the internet).


# About Midi/Karaoke Files

Those *.mid or *.kar files usually consist of several tracks, including percussion.  You probably would not want to play percussion-tracks on piano, because their "MIDI-notes" do not overload correctly on piano-notes.  So, in the most cases, you may choose any kind of tracks, but percussions (like "Drums", "Rythms", "Hit", "Blow", "Strike", "Clash", etc.) will be disabled.


# System Requirements

Windows 7 or later.


# How to Install

[Download the latest zip-archive](https://GitHub.com/BShakhovsky/PianoFingers3D/releases/download/2017-02-21/PianoFingers3D.zip)

If you encounter errors about missing DLL's, try to __*reinstall the latest possible DirectX (even if you already have it):*__

If there is still some error, then sorry, you are screwed :disappointed:


# How to Use

1. Drag-and-drop any MIDI- or Karaoke-file onto the applcation.

2. Select appropriate track for left hand, and another track for right hand.  Finger numbers for left hand will be drawn with blue color, for right hand - with red.  If you are not interested in finger numbers, you can skip this step.

   (!) This option is *EXPERIMENTAL*, and __*finger numbers are not correct in 25% of cases!*__  Keep this in mind and do not blindly believe them.

3. Select any additional tracks in "Remaining Tracks" list, if you want.  Finger numbers for those additional tracks will not be calculated or drawn.  Percussion-tracks (like "Drums", "Rythms", "Hit", "Blow", "Strike", "Clash", etc.) will be disabled.

4. If you want to go forward or backwards chord-by-chord, you can use scroll-bar left or right button.  Or if you want just to play the song in real time, press "Play" button.  For smoother performance, try not to move mouse over the program while playing in 3D-mode.

5. By default each note is being played with different volume.  If you want all notes to be played with the same maximal loudness, check "Normalize volume" box.

6. Use left mouse button to rotate, middle (or press mouse wheel) to move, scroll mouse wheel to zoom, double click on mouse wheel to fit the piano inside the window.  Right click --> choose context menu to restore the default 3D-piano position.

7. Enjoy :smile:
