Steps:

1. Drag-and-drop any *.mid (MIDI) of *.kar (Karaoke) file onto the applcation.

2. Select appropriate track for left hand, and another track for right hand.

   Finger numbers for left hand will be drawn with blue color, for right hand - with red.

   If you are not interested in finger numbers, you can skip this step.

3. Select any additional tracks in "Remaining Tracks" list, if you want.

   Finger numbers for those additional tracks will not be calculated or drawn.

4. If you want to go forward or backwards chord-by-chord, you can use scroll-bar left or right button.

5. Or if you want just to play the song in real time, press "Play" button.

6. Use left mouse button to rotate, right - to move, wheel - to zoom.

7. Enjoy :)
